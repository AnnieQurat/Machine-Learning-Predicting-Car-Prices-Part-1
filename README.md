# Predicting Car Prices (Part 1) 

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Using the dataset containing sales prices of cars, eprocess and prepare the data to apply the machine learning knowledge studied in Book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. This will include creating, analysing and generating predictions with regression models.

Firstly, learning the basic data prepartion steps:

1) Split data to train and test
2) Drop missing values or select non-null values from the 'y' variable
3) Fill missing values in 'x' valurable with median values
4) Visualize all the data with histograms
5) Output top 5 correlations of 'x' with 'y' and scatterplot them 

Also, using the previous data preparation, we'll predict car prices using several Machine Learning Algorithms:

1) Linear Regression 
2) 5-fold Cross Validation
3) Polynomial transformation with degree 2 to add the square values of each feature
4) Lasso regularization with just one alpha, and also a range of alphas
5) Plotting the lasso regularization curve
6) Doing Grid Search for SVR (Support Vector Regression) to output the best paramaters 

I learned so much through this very introductory Machine Learning assignment, which focused on use of SkLearn library for data cleaning, pre-processing, importing libraries for regression models and plotting the graph.
